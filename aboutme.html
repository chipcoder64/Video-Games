                <p>Hi my name is Ciprian I was born in Europe Romania, I came to the U.S. in 1992. I'm a web developer who loves video games. I've played video games since 1994 when one of my friends introduced me to Super Mario Bro's for the NES. He soon bought himself a Super Nintendo and then sold me his NES which my dad bought. I was hooked on Mario played for hours, beat it over and over again. After a few months my brother and I looked everywhere for NES games. Swap Meets, Garage Sales, Thrift Stores, and I was broke, barely had anything since my parents both came from Romania and making money was hard for them since they spoke very little English. I couldn't find any cheap games since in 1994 SNES just came out and NES games were still in the 50$ at the local electronic stores. But I found ways to play games, Best Buy and CompUsa(RIP...) had games on display SNES, Genesis, Nintendo, and Pc games which I played almost everyday after school. My birthday came and my dad bought me <a class="tooltip" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:_Bart_vs._the_World">Bart vs the world<span><img src="bartvsworld.jpg" alt="Bart vs The World Video Game">The Simpsons Video Game For NES.</span></a> for NES. That game is crazy hard it took me years to beat it not until I was 23 that I finally beat it almost 8 years later, so I got so frustrated that I gave up on the game in just a few short months. Soon after I made enough money to buy another game Robocop for the NES, another hard game, most NES were really hard especially Contra but fun at the same time. Robocop a game based on the movie but didn't even come close, but I enjoyed it as a kid now looking at it I think to myself how did I even play that game I can't even finish the first level. As the years went on I got a Super Nintendo, a Sega Genesis, Sony Playstation, I owned almost every console ever made. Since I started playing games to today I played over 200 games.
